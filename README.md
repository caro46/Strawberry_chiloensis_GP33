# Strawberry_chiloensis_GP33

This repository contains the scripts used to produce the figures of Cauret et al. 2022: Chromosome-scale assembly with a phased sex-determining region resolves features of early Z and W chromosome differentiation in a wild octoploid strawberry

`cov.R`: produces the Fig. 3, i.e. combination of a dotplot of the Z and W sequence, coverage analysis (difference between females and males), and repeat coverage.

`dotplot.R`: produces 4 dotplots (3 genome wide, 1 subset of homeologs of group 6): figures S1, S2, S3 and main Fig. 2
